## What are the requirements to run an app using webview?

On MacOS and on Windows there are no external dependencies to install. You may
distribute a single binary and it would just work.

On Linux `webkit-gtk` library is a dependency. On Debian/Ubuntu it can be installed

## Is this library thread-safe?

Dispatch()

* ico

## Why JS bindings use `window.external.invoke_()` function name and not something shorter?

* MSHTML uses `window.external.<something>`.
* Cocoa-Webkit uses `name_` (appends underscore after a name).

## How can I debug my HTML/JS part of the app?

console.log()
Debug
